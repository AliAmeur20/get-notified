# GetNotified üöÄ

GetNotified is a robust web application built on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) designed to provide efficient alerts, notifications, and messaging using **RabbitMQ**. Developed as part of my master‚Äôs graduation project, this application showcases a seamless integration of real-time communication and a clean, responsive user interface.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Before running the application, ensure the following environment variables are set:

### Required Environment Variables

- `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `RABBITMQ_URL`: Your RabbitMQ server URL.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

### Steps to Configure

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following variables to the `.env` file:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/getnotified
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```
